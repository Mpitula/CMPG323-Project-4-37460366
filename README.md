## This project automates User Acceptance Testing (UAT) using UiPath

**Overview**

This UiPath project automates the Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on a web application for managing clients and projects, using data from an Excel file. The automation also updates the Excel file with the results of each operation, showing whether it passed or failed.

+ Create: Add new clients and projects based on the Excel data.
+ Read: Verifies that clients and projects were successfully created.
+ Update: Edits existing client and project records.
+ Delete: Removes clients and projects from the web application.
