## This project automates User Acceptance Testing (UAT) using UiPath

This UiPath project automates the Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on a web application for managing clients and projects, using data from an Excel file. The automation also updates the Excel file with the results of each operation, showing whether it passed or failed.
